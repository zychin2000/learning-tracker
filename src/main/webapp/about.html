          <p>
            Our seven principles of learning come from a perspective that is
developmental and holistic. In other words, we begin with the
recognition that learning is a developmental process that intersects
with other developmental processes in a student ’ s life.
          <p class="dark">
students enter our classrooms not only with skills, knowledge,
and abilities, but also with social and emotional experiences that
infl uence what they value, how they perceive themselves and
others, and how they will engage in the learning process. Consistent
with this holistic perspective, readers should understand that,
although we address each principle individually to highlight particular
issues pertaining to student learning, they are all at work
in real learning situations and are functionally inseparable.          </p>

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>we are creating a web platform for college students to share their learning processes in a certain class, which could be used as a form of creating community as well as turning learning to not “act as a private good”.
